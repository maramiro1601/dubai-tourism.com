        <p>The building is an architectural and engineering marvel.  </p>

        <p>It confidently straddles the past and the future, applying advanced 
			technology to traditional artforms.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="info-section" style="display: none;">
        <p>The building ‘speaks Arabic’: its facade is a canvas for
			the poetry of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum rendered in the calligraphy
			of Mattar bin Lahej.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="info-section" style="display: none;">
        <p>Explore the jewel 
			of Jumeirah and enjoy its private beach.</p>

	<div class="info-section" style="display: none;">
        <p>The building’s form is futuristic: it opens a new path away from the highrise 
			towers that dominate skylines everywhere.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" style="display: none;">
        <p> Its form is symbolic: The circular building represents humanity; 
			the green mound it sits atop represents the earth; the void represents the unknown future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" style="display: none;">
        <p>The Museum of The
			Future  shows the visitors how the world, especially Dubai,
			will be 50 years from now.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="info-section" style="display: none;">
        <p> A visit to this museum doesn't take you to the past, as museums usually do.</p>
